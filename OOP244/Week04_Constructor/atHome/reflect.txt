1)What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state?
This is user-made empty state of variables. 
We make this to avoid showing garbage data and easy to find empty variables.
For example, if there is variable represents the year. Before user type in the year or if the year is not valid, 
we can put data 0 in the variable as safe empty state.
So that we can easily detect if there is empty state.
Also, in case it's printed out, it's easier to detect and readable than garbage value. 

2)Describe how you have minimized code duplication.
I used isEmpty() function for name() and display() to check if the Passenger object is in a safe empty state.
So that I didn't have to type or the if statement repeatedly. 

3)Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the private data of the object referenced in its parameter.
Because private variable can be accessed in the class.
canTraveWith(...) function is Passenger class' member function. 
It's implemented in the class, so, it can access to private variables.

4)What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes correctly?
Because we choose the length we want to copy, it possibly not includes terminal character.
So I should make sure if copied variable includes terminal character, '\0'.
Also, depends on the version of complier we use, it can be not allowed due to secure warning.
In this case we can add "#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" to prevent the problem.

5)Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
- The concept of safe empty state and how to use it and why we need it
- It should be "*this = [Constructor]" to put default value in the object
- Reuse function to avoid duplication
- How to use debug mode correctly
- How to compare to C-string values
- How to make constructor
- How to overload constructor
