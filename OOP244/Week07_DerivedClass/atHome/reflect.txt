1. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere?) 
No it doesn't have to know about the SuperHero.

2. Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: do a search in SuperHero.cpp, does the word “Hero” appear anywhere?)
Yes it should know about Hero.

3. The program prints out “Ancient Battle!” when 2 Heroes fight. It prints out “Super Fight!” when 2 SuperHeroes fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero, what did it print out?
It shows "Ancient Battle!"

4. True or False: are the following definitions for main valid? 
int main() {
  Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5);
}
True (but guess it should return int value for main)

how about this?

int main() {
 (Hero("Achilles", 20, 6) * Hero("Hector", 30, 5)) 
                          *
 (Hero("Atalanta", 10, 3) * Hero("Hippolyta", 10, 2));
}

True (but guess it should return int value for main)
