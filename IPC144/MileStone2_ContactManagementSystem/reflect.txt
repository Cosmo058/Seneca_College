1.Briefly explain why you think this assignment has asked you to 
code a struct, Contact, that holds three other structs as data members.
As the struct Name, Address, Numbers are always going together.
So to prevent wasting time to declare 3 structs every time we use, 
we make Contact struct to hold those 3 structs.
It will be clearer and effective.

2. What was the most difficult part of this assignment?
I couldn't understand contacts.c and a1ms4.c are seperated, 
but a1m4.c still can use declared functions from contacts.c.
So I got confused at the first 5~10 minutes.

3. How long did it tak you to complete Milestone 4? 
roughly 30 mins
