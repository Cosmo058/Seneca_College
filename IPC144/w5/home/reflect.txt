1)In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data 
We don't have to use many variables for many fields. Structure can contain as many as I want. Besides, easy to update information or remove as it's already in same index in same variable.

2)The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why. Hint: this is explained in the notes.
If we use header file, we can use the structure in many files by #include [headerfilename] without declaring it again and again.
